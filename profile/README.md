## 𝙰𝚋𝚘𝚞𝚝

**𝙼𝚒𝚗𝚒𝚖𝚊𝚕** is a compiled, general-purpose programming language with high-level syntax, but low-level control and speep.<br/>
The compiler writes the minimum amount of Assembly instructions possible, so that the language reaches the peak of its speed.

The language is also very customizable, you can create your own statements or expression nodes, by doing this the code will be more readable and easier to develop and debug.

**𝙼𝚒𝚗𝚒𝚖𝚊𝚕** can be changed though plugins that are able to change absolutly the language.<br/>
They make possible even the creation of a transpiler from any language to **𝙼𝚒𝚗𝚒𝚖𝚊𝚕** only with a plugin.
