## Features of Minimal

- Constants creation in runtime;
- Asynchronous processes safely (e.g.: _goroutines_);
- Operations clearly explicit, but with the possibility of abstractions;
- Return of more than one value from a function;
- Strongly typed (to the extreme).

### Paradigms

- Functional;
- Procedural;
- **Complete** object orientation.

### Simple, low-typing syntax

- Similar to **C**/**Go** with some traces of **ALGOL 68**, **Assembly** and **Rust**.

### Safety

- Runtime type checking;
- `null` does not exist.
