### 𝙼𝚎𝚖𝚋𝚎𝚛𝚜
**Creator:** [@JuniorBecari10](https://github.com/juniorbecari10)

## 𝙰𝚋𝚘𝚞𝚝

**𝙼𝚒𝚗𝚒𝚖𝚊𝚕** is a compiled, general-purpose systems programming language with high-level syntax, but with low-level control and speed.<br/>
The compiler writes the minimum amount of Assembly instructions possible, so that the language reaches the peak of its speed.
> **todo!** the backend can be overwritten, so that you can compile to every platform and language possible!

The language is simple and easy to learn, but also very powerful.

<br/>

## 𝚃𝚑𝚎 𝙲𝚘𝚖𝚙𝚒𝚕𝚎𝚛

The **𝙼𝚒𝚗𝚒𝚖𝚊𝚕** compiler is very fast and its error messages are very helpful.<br/>
Every error that occurs is known and has a specific code for it, and the error messages detail the error and give hints to help you solve them.

## 𝚂𝚢𝚗𝚝𝚊𝚡

Like said before, **𝙼𝚒𝚗𝚒𝚖𝚊𝚕** has a high-level and easy to understand syntax. <br>
The keywords are short, but easily readable.

Example of a Hello World program:
```rust
fn main() {
  println("Hello, World!")
}
```

For more information about the syntax or anything related to the language, check out our [Docs](https://github.com/minimal-lang/docs)!<br/>
_(they aren't boring long lines of text)._
