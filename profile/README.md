The language is under heavy development, and you can help us develop it!
Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/F3Uh9W4g), and apply to be a developer (there is a channel explaining how to do it).

## 𝙰𝚋𝚘𝚞𝚝

Minimal is a compiled, general-purpose programming language with high-level syntax, but with low-level control and speed. <br>
The compiler will write the minimum amount of Assembly instructions possible, so that the language reaches the peak of its speed.

The language is also very customizable, you can create your own statements or expression nodes, by doing this the code will be more readable and easier to develop and debug.

## 𝚃𝚑𝚎 𝙲𝚘𝚖𝚙𝚒𝚕𝚎𝚛
The Minimal compiler is very fast and its error messages are very helpful. With Minimal, solving compiler errors is easy! <br>
Tom will be your best friend.

### 𝙼𝚎𝚎𝚝 𝚃𝚘𝚖
Tom will be your best friend while programming in Minimal, he will always help you developing your programs:

```
 /\_/\
( o.o ) Hello!
 > ^ <
```

## 𝚂𝚢𝚗𝚝𝚊𝚡

Like said before, Minimal has a high-level and easy to understand syntax. <br>
The keywords are short, but easily readable.

Example of a Hello World program:
```rust
fn main {
  println("Hello, World!")
}
```
