### Characteristics of Minimal
</div>

Constants creation in runtime  
Asynchronous processes safely (e.g.: _goroutines_)  
Operations clearly explicit, but with the possibility of abstractions  
Return of more than one value from a function  
Strongly typed (to the extreme)

**Compatible paradigms:**
- Functional
- **Complete** object orientation

**Simple, low-typing syntax:**
- Similar to **C**/**Go** with some traces of **ALGOL 68** and **Assembly**
- Removing unnecessary characters:
  - `()` in functions without parameters

**Safety:**
- Runtime type checking
